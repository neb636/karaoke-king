# Karaoke King — App Vision

## What This App Is

A competitive multiplayer karaoke game designed for groups of friends and family. The energy is closer to Guitar Hero than a serious singing competition — it's about the moment, the laughs, and the spectacle of watching someone commit fully to a song.

## Core Philosophy

**Fun first, scoring second.**

The app should make everyone feel like a star regardless of actual singing ability. A bad singer going all-in should score well. A technically proficient singer phoning it in should not. The scoring exists to create stakes and competition, not to gatekeep based on vocal talent.

This means:
- Effort and energy are rewarded over precision
- The experience of playing should feel exciting even when you're losing
- Nobody should feel embarrassed or excluded

## Who Is Playing This

Real scenarios this is built for:
- Family game nights with a mix of ages and abilities
- Friend group hangouts where people are already loosened up
- Party settings where turns rotate quickly and people watch each other

## Accessibility Is a Feature

The bumpers system (a 30% score boost) exists so kids, elderly players, and beginners can compete meaningfully with more experienced players. This is not a crutch — it's the point. The game should bring people together across skill levels, not sort them by ability.

Future handicap tiers to consider:
- **Kids** — slower songs, simpler lyrics, very forgiving thresholds
- **Elders** — classic hits from their era, extended timing windows
- **Beginners** — encouragement-focused feedback, pitch guide overlay
- **Pros** — no assists, stricter thresholds

## What Success Looks Like

A round of Karaoke King is successful when:
- Someone who "can't sing" gets a high score and feels amazing
- The room is watching, laughing, and reacting — not staring at their phones
- Players immediately want another round
- Everyone has a story to tell from the session ("remember when Dave did that Celine Dion verse?")

## Current Format

Players take turns singing a song they've chosen (currently via Spotify on their phone, which also shows them synced lyrics). The app listens via microphone, scores the performance across energy, pitch variety, sustain, and duration, and tracks cumulative scores across rounds.

Game modes range from a quick single-round match to a 10-round marathon.
