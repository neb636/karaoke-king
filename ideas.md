# Karaoke King

## Core Concept

A competitive multiplayer karaoke game that connects to players' music libraries to create personalized, high-energy singing battles. Similar energy to Guitar hero.

At the core this will prioritize fun with others over singing quality. A silly party game with friends or family.

## Spotify Integration

- Connect multiple user Spotify accounts
- Analyze listening history to suggest songs players actually know
- Create "common ground" playlists from overlapping tastes
- Difficulty ratings based on vocal range, tempo, and lyric complexity

## Game Modes

### 1. Free-for-All (Party Mode)

- Casual, no scoring pressure
- Pass-the-mic style or simultaneous singing
- Great for warming up or just having fun

### 2. Competition Mode

**Handicap System** (like bowling bumpers):

- **Kids**: Slower songs, simpler lyrics, more forgiving pitch detection
- **Elders**: Classic hits from their era, extended timing windows
- **Beginners**: Lyric hints, pitch guide overlay
- **Pros**: No assists, stricter scoring

**Scoring Factors**:

- Pitch accuracy
- Timing/rhythm
- Lyric accuracy (optional mic input)
- Style points (crowd vote?)

### 3. Elimination Mode

**Round Structure**:

- All players start, lowest scorer eliminated each round
- Tension builds as field narrows
- **Top 4**: Songs get harder, less popular deep cuts
- **Top 3**: "Heat Zone" - faster tempo songs, tighter scoring
- **Final 2**: The Duel

## The Duel (Final Showdown)

### Format

- Head-to-head battle
- **Mashup Medley**: 5 songs intertwined in ~2 minutes
- Rapid genre/tempo switches to test versatility

### Sudden Death Mechanics

- **Pitch Strike System**: 3 strikes (off-key sections) and you're out
- **Cut-off Rule**: Fall too far behind on accuracy = song cuts to opponent
- **Steal the Verse**: If one player fumbles, other can "steal" their section for bonus points

### Song Selection for Duel

- Algorithm picks challenging songs neither player has in their Spotify history
- Mix of genres to prevent home-field advantage
- Crowd/audience can vote on "wildcard" song
